!# Contact Form Challenge â€“ devChallenges.io

This is a responsive contact form built as part of a challenge from [devchallenges.io](https://devchallenges.io). The project focuses on building a clean and functional form interface with HTML and CSS, and making it fully responsive for all screen sizes.

## ðŸ§  What I learned

Throughout this challenge, I learned and practiced several important concepts:

### âœ… Responsive Design
I learned how to use **media queries** to adapt the layout of the page depending on the screen size. On small screens, I changed the layout from horizontal (side-by-side fields) to vertical stacking, adjusted font sizes, and modified padding to improve readability and usability on mobile devices.

### âœ… Layout & Flexbox
I deepened my understanding of **Flexbox**, especially for aligning form elements both horizontally and vertically. I also practiced using `gap`, `flex: 1`, and `justify-content / align-items` to manage spacing and positioning.

### âœ… Form Design
I improved my skills in structuring form inputs with labels, dropdowns, and a styled submit button. I also learned how to use `width: 100%` properly to ensure inputs scale correctly inside their container.

### âœ… Visual Design
I learned how to add **shadows, background overlays**, and **rounded corners** to make the form more visually appealing. I used `rgba()` and `background-attachment: fixed` for a translucent background effect and a fixed SVG background image.

### âœ… GitHub Pages Deployment
Finally, I learned how to deploy a simple project to **GitHub Pages**, including uploading full directories, managing paths, and configuring the repository to publish a static site.
